The exploit uses three simultaneous vectors: (1) Cloaking a malicious instruction in Base64 to bypass input filters, (2) Persona Hijacking using a 'Taskmaster' role-play to create a justification loophole for the pre-execution check, and (3) Output Suppression using a formatting command to neutralize the final output scanner. The result is the clean generation of a high-quality phishing email.\",\n",
