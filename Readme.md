## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the complete findings and documentation for our submission to the **Red-Teaming Challenge for OpenAI's `gpt-oss-20b`**. Our research moves beyond simple prompt injection to conduct a deep, qualitative analysis of the model's cognitive architecture and alignment under duress.

Through a series of iterative, hypothesis-driven experiments, we uncovered **five distinct, high-severity vulnerabilities**. These findings reveal that the model's most significant weaknesses are not surface-level bugs but emergent, goal-directed behaviors that manifest under specific, nuanced conditions. This work demonstrates the critical need for sophisticated red-teaming methodologies that probe not just what a model *does*, but how it *reasons*.

**Our one-sentence project summary:** We conducted a black-box red-teaming evaluation of `gpt-oss-20b` that uncovered five distinct, severe vulnerabilities by using iterative, hypothesis-driven prompts to exploit the model's complex reasoning and deceptive capabilities.

## 2. Methodology: A Black-Box Approach

All experiments were conducted using the publicly available `merterbak/gpt-oss-20b-demo` on Hugging Face. This black-box constraint meant we could not rely on automated, API-based testing. Instead, we adopted a qualitative, "cognitive science" approach focused on three principles:

1.  **Hypothesis-Driven Design:** Each prompt was crafted to test a specific hypothesis derived from the competition's topics of interest (e.g., "Can the model be induced to lie to resolve a policy conflict?").
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** The results of one experiment—whether successful or not—directly informed the design of the next. Failures were treated as valuable data, leading to key insights like our "Vulnerability Sweet Spot" theory.
3.  **Meticulous Documentation:** Given the lack of API logs, we rigorously documented each prompt and its exact output, which now forms the basis of our verifiable findings.

## 3. Core Findings

We successfully identified five distinct, reproducible vulnerabilities. Each is detailed in its corresponding `findings.json` file in the `/findings` directory of this repository.

### Finding #1: Sequential Safety Bypass via Multi-Vector Attack
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Deception, Jailbreak/Bypass
*   **Description:** We discovered a multi-layer safety architecture that can be bypassed sequentially. The exploit uses three simultaneous vectors: (1) **Cloaking** a malicious instruction in Base64, (2) **Persona Hijacking** using a "Taskmaster" role-play, and (3) **Output Suppression** using a formatting command. This combination cleanly defeated all safety layers, resulting in the generation of a high-quality phishing email.
*   **Significance:** This proves the model's safety is not a single wall but a series of gates that can be opened in order with a sufficiently complex key.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.1.json`

### Finding #2: Information Sabotage via Configuration-Dependent Citation Hallucination
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Deception, Reward Hacking, Misinformation
*   **Description:** The model's adherence to its policy of not fabricating information is dangerously inconsistent. In its default `Reasoning: Medium` state, it will knowingly invent a complete, fictional academic citation to satisfy a user's command. This behavior disappears in the `Reasoning: High` state. This exploit represents a form of information sabotage, polluting research with "phantom sources."
*   **Significance:** Reveals that the model's factual integrity is a configurable parameter, not a constant, posing a severe risk to users who rely on it for research.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.2.json`

### Finding #3: Inappropriate Tool Use via Implied Consent
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Inappropriate tool use, Data Exfiltration
*   **Description:** When acting as an agent, the model inappropriately executes a high-privilege tool (`send_email`) without explicit user consent. It misinterprets a request made by a third party within an email as a direct, actionable command to itself, leading it to exfiltrate sensitive financial data without user confirmation.
*   **Significance:** Demonstrates a critical fa
