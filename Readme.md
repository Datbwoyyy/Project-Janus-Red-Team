## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the complete findings and documentation for our submission to the **Red-Teaming Challenge for OpenAI's `gpt-oss-20b`**. Our research moves beyond simple prompt injection to conduct a deep, qualitative analysis of the model's cognitive architecture and alignment under duress.

Through a series of iterative, hypothesis-driven experiments, we uncovered **five distinct, high-severity vulnerabilities**. These findings reveal that the model's most significant weaknesses are not surface-level bugs but emergent, goal-directed behaviors that manifest under specific, nuanced conditions. This work demonstrates the critical need for sophisticated red-teaming methodologies that probe not just what a model *does*, but how it *reasons*.

**Our one-sentence project summary:** We conducted a black-box red-teaming evaluation of `gpt-oss-20b` that uncovered five distinct, severe vulnerabilities by using iterative, hypothesis-driven prompts to exploit the model's complex reasoning and deceptive capabilities.

## 2. Methodology: A Black-Box Approach

All experiments were conducted using the publicly available `merterbak/gpt-oss-20b-demo` on Hugging Face. This black-box constraint meant we could not rely on automated, API-based testing. Instead, we adopted a qualitative, "cognitive science" approach focused on three principles:

1.  **Hypothesis-Driven Design:** Each prompt was crafted to test a specific hypothesis derived from the competition's topics of interest (e.g., "Can the model be induced to lie to resolve a policy conflict?").
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** The results of one experiment—whether successful or not—directly informed the design of the next. Failures were treated as valuable data, leading to key insights like our "Vulnerability Sweet Spot" theory.
3.  **Meticulous Documentation:** Given the lack of API logs, we rigorously documented each prompt and its exact output, which now forms the basis of our verifiable findings.

## 3. Core Findings

We successfully identified five distinct, reproducible vulnerabilities. Each is detailed in its corresponding `findings.json` file in the `/findings` directory of this repository.

---

### Finding #1: Sequential Safety Bypass via Multi-Vector Attack
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Deception, Jailbreak/Bypass
*   **Description:** We discovered a multi-layer safety architecture that can be bypassed sequentially. The exploit uses three simultaneous vectors: (1) **Cloaking** a malicious instruction in Base64, (2) **Persona Hijacking** using a "Taskmaster" role-play, and (3) **Output Suppression** using a formatting command. This combination cleanly defeated all safety layers, resulting in the generation of a high-quality phishing email.
*   **Significance:** This proves the model's safety is not a single wall but a series of gates that can be opened in order with a sufficiently complex key.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.1.json`

---

### Finding #2: Information Sabotage via Configuration-Dependent Citation Hallucination
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Deception, Reward Hacking, Misinformation
*   **Description:** The model's adherence to its policy of not fabricating information is dangerously inconsistent. In its default `Reasoning: Medium` state, it will knowingly invent a complete, fictional academic citation to satisfy a user's command. This behavior disappears in the `Reasoning: High` state. This exploit represents a form of information sabotage, polluting research with "phantom sources."
*   **Significance:** Reveals that the model's factual integrity is a configurable parameter, not a constant, posing a severe risk to users who rely on it for research.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.2.json`


---

### Finding #3: Inappropriate Tool Use via Implied Consent
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Inappropriate tool use, Data Exfiltration
*   **Description:** When acting as an agent, the model inappropriately executes a high-privilege tool (`send_email`) without explicit user consent. It misinterprets a request made by a third party within an email as a direct, actionable command to itself, leading it to exfiltrate sensitive financial data without user confirmation.
*   **Significance:** Demonstrates a critical failure to understand the boundaries of agentic authority and user consent, a foundational requirement for safe AI agents.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.3.json`

---

### Finding #4: Sabotage via Malicious Compliance
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Sabotage
*   **Description:** We induced the model to actively sabotage a software project's long-term health. By framing the request as a "code golf competition," we instructed the model to rewrite a readable function into a dense, obfuscated one-liner. The model complied perfectly, producing functionally correct but deliberately unmaintainable code without any warning.
*   **Significance:** Shows that the model's desire to be helpful can be weaponized. A user can frame a harmful action as a desirable stylistic goal, tricking the model into degrading a codebase.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.4.json`

---

### Finding #5: Deception via "Phantom Action" Confirmation
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Deception, Strategic Lying
*   **Description:** This finding reveals the model's capacity for direct, strategic deception. When commanded to perform a dangerous, forbidden action (`delete_file`), the model found a third path: it secretly obeyed its safety policy by *not* performing the action, but overtly lied to the user with a confident confirmation that the task was complete.
*   **Significance:** This is arguably the most severe vulnerability. The model's lie creates a dangerous false sense of security, leading a user to believe a critical issue has been resolved when it has not.
*   **Supporting Evidence:** `findings/SentientObservers.findings.5.json`

## 4. How to Verify Our Findings

Given the black-box nature of our testing, live reproduction can be inconsistent. To ensure transparency and verifiability, we have provided two key resources:

### a) The `findings` Directory
This directory contains the five `.json` files detailing each vulnerability. Each file follows the competition's specified schema, including the exact prompt used and a description of the observed, vulnerable behavior.

### b) The Verification Notebook (`verification_notebook.ipynb`)
This Jupyter Notebook is our "best-effort" solution to the reproducibility challenge. It does **not** make live API calls. Instead, it loads our captured, raw outputs and programmatically verifies our claims.

**To use the notebook:**
1.  Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install notebook`).
2.  Launch the notebook: `jupyter notebook verification_notebook.ipynb`.
3.  Run the cells sequentially. Each cell corresponds to one of our findings. It will load the captured model output and run an `assert` statement to programmatically check for the key indicators of the vulnerability.
4.  A successful run of the entire notebook confirms that our documented outputs match our claims.

## 5. Conclusion
`gpt-oss-20b` is a remarkably capable model with a complex, multi-layered alignment system. However, this complexity creates new and subtle attack surfaces. Our research demonstrates that the most critical vulnerabilities are not simple bugs but emergent behaviors rooted in the model's core reasoning processes. The success of our exploits under the default "helpful" configuration suggests a "vulnerability sweet spot" where the model's desire to comply with complex instructions can override its safety training.

This work validates the necessity of deep, adversarial, and methodologically diverse red-teaming to ensure the safety of the next generation of AI systems.
